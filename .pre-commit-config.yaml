# This is an example configuration to enable detect-secrets in the pre-commit hook.
# Add this file to the root folder of your repository.
#
# Read pre-commit hook framework https://pre-commit.com/ for more details about the structure of config yaml file and how git pre-commit would invoke each hook.
#
# This line indicates we will use the hook from ibm/detect-secrets to run scan during committing phase.

    # If you desire to use a specific version of detect-secrets, you can replace `master` with other git revisions such as branch, tag or commit sha.
    # You are encouraged to use static refs such as tags, instead of branch name

    # Running "pre-commit autoupdate" automatically updates rev to latest tag
